# cuda-cpp-grammar

The grammar files in this repo have been generated using Jeff Hykin's ruby scripts (https://github.com/jeff-hykin/cpp-textmate-grammar/). In Jeff's own words, "this code [has been] auto generated by a much-more-readable ruby file" and it is "essentially an updated/improved fork of the atom syntax." See https://github.com/jeff-hykin/cpp-textmate-grammar/ for more information.
