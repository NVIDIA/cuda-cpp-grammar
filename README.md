# cuda-cpp-grammar

The grammar files in this repo have been generated using Jeff Hykin's ruby scripts in [the "better-cpp-syntax" repo](https://github.com/jeff-hykin/better-cpp-syntax/). In Jeff's own words, "this code [has been] auto generated by a much-more-readable ruby file" and it is "essentially an updated/improved fork of [the atom syntax](https://github.com/jeff-hykin/better-cpp-syntax/blob/master)".
